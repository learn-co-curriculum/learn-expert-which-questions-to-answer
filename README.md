This might sound overwhelming, but if you've gone through the Full Stack course work, supporting the other tracks should be no problem as the content in them comes primarily from Full Stack. 

Also, you don't have to memorize these track names. We've set up learn.co/expert-chat so that only questions on supported batches show up there. That being said, there are still some questions that come through that we do not support.

It's also worth noting that we direct some questions that we cannot answer directly. We can escalate questions regarding bugs, billing, admissions, etc... (more on these later!)

## Unsupported Questions

**We do not support questions on student assessments.** If a student asks a question about their assessment, we want to say something like this: 

Hey {name}, we can't actually support questions on assessments through Ask A Question. However, there are several resources you can take advantage of to help with your project. There are frequent study groups focused on portfolio projects. There are also quite a few videos you can search through at http://instruction.learn.co. Finally, if you've tried study groups and still need more, you can book a 30-min session with a Portfolio Support Coach. For more info and the link to book a session, you can check out this article on the help center: http://help.learn.co/instructional-support/receiving-course-support/who-can-i-contact-for-help-on-my-portfolio-project
